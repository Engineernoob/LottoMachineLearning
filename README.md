# LottoMachineLearning
An educational tool designed to analyze past lottery results from games like Mega Millions and PowerBall to determine patterns and trends. **Note: This tool is strictly for educational purposes and does not claim to predict future lottery results accurately.**

## Overview

This project dives into past lottery numbers, exploring their distributions for different games. Using basic frequency analysis, we aim to identify patterns, albeit for theoretical understanding rather than genuine prediction.

## Features

- **Historical Data Analysis:** Analyze which numbers appear most and least frequently for each game.
- **Hypothetical Prediction:** Suggest numbers based on their past frequency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas: Install using `pip install pandas`

### Data Collection

Collect past lottery results for each game (Mega Millions and PowerBall) and store them in separate CSV files. Each row should represent a draw date and the corresponding drawn numbers.

### Running the Tool

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-link]
